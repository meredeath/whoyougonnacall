 * attempted to include challenges as well as multiple players but due to compliing issues left it out of final version (Meredith and Fabiha)
 * made interface slightly better looking, updated readme one last time (Meredith)
~Note 2: Challenges are not needed because we made a design choice to include in the binary search algorithm automatic invalidation of invalid prefixes. A combination of letters that does not form the prefix of a word in the dictionary is invalidated and the player who entered the wrong combination loses the round, while the other player wins by default.
